# Report 4 - Week of 9/19/24 - I love mapping!

<h2>Reflections</h2>
In wrapping up the Computational Design project, I spent most of this week finalizing my report. I put a lot of effort into this, and learned the importance of quality presentations through getting feedback from peers. I feel proud of the report and overall project I submitted for computational design! 

On Monday we put project 1 behind us and shifted to THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM!! The first assignment, creating a map of an ecosystem, was particularly fun for me.

Prior to MDes, I spent four years as a management consulant, in part doing service design work. While I am new to CAD modeling, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc., ecosystem mapping is something I have done many times. In my role, we did many types of maps such as ecosystem maps, stakeholder maps, service design blueprints, journey maps, and more. This week, I decided to create a service design blueprint for a personal device ecosystem, specfically the action of using a phone to take a photo.

I love service design blueprints because I think they do a great job showing a user's journey, what they interct with (frontstage), and what happens behind the scenes to enable their experience (backstage) in a clear, comprehendable way. In this blueprint, the arrows indicate connections, and I added icons to specifically call out at which steps information flow and feedback occurs. I also added enabling systems at the bottom, which at a very high level gets into the technology within the phone that enables the backstage actions, frontstage actions, and ultimately the user journey.

<h2>Speculations</h2>
In my former work, we embraced ecosystems and used maps to document current states, make predictions and recomendations, define ideal futute states, and more. I speculate more industries will adopt this practice to further whatever work they are doing, if they haven't already done so. 


# Report 3 - Week of 9/12/24 - Big week for me, Grasshopper, and 3D printing

<h2>Reflections</h2>
I learned A LOT this week. I 3D printed for the first time, learned a lot more about Rhino and Grasshopper, used Rhino to both 3D print and laser cut, and more! This was an especially inspiring week because I feel like I not only pushed myself and grew a ton, I also had so much support for the MDes and Jacobs Hall community. To list a few moments that I was grateful for--one of my classmates walked me through using the Jacob's 3D printers step by step without my even asking, Cody in the makerspace sat with me and took the time to help me truly understand Grasshopper, I watched people in my cohort stay late late into the evening to help other get their work done. The community became strong this week.

As for my own personal contributions, I repaid the favors in every way I could--helping others set up their prints, printing a part when someone had to leave campus, etc.

I am proud of the work I have done so far, including the parts I printed and the video I created for this project. Here are the parts!

To make these, I did not start with hand sketches. I played with Rhino and Grasshopper until my loose vision came to life. In please of sketches, here are the models I "sketeched."

<h2>Speculations</h2>
I speculate computational design will continue to evlove with tools like Adam. We had a demostration of this AI modeling tool in DESINV 200, and it blew my mind. It really seemed huge. I also have been thinking espeically hard about the useage of plastics in 3D printing, and I predict there will be more sustainable materials emerging.

# Report 2 - Week of 9/5/24 - I've never touched rhino or grasshopper until this week (embarrassing!!)

<h2>Reflections</h2>
Overall, I was challenged this week. Grasshopper and Rhino are tools I have never touched, and the last time I tried modeling in a CAD program was in 2016 ðŸ¥². To grow these nex skills, I focused on the following 3 assignments:

  1. Make a diagram of the example phone stand grasshopping file
  2. Experiment with the example phone stand grasshopping file (adjusting parameters and baking)
  3. Experiment with generating a new basic grasshopper file
<br />
<br />
<ins> Make a diagram of the example phone stand grasshopping</ins> 
This process was very interesting! Going through a the grasshopper file step by step and digesting it enough to reframe it was a great way for me to learn. This (paired with the 9/9 class grasshopper workshop) has been the first time grasshopper started to sink in. 

To create this diagram, I had both figjam and the grasshopper up on my screen, and I went step by step in grasshopper, traslating my understadning into figjam. Here it is!

<br />
<br />
<br />
<ins> Experiment with the example phone stand file (adjusting parameters and baking)</ins> 
This was a fun exercise and a great way to play with grasshopper without having any prior experience. Here are all the ways documented I manipulated the file (I did a lot more poking, but at some point taking screen shots seemed redundant).

Starting point:

<br />

<br />
Having fun with unrealistic phone sizes and shapes through grasshopper:

<br />
<img width="200" alt="rhino6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617602ce-5db7-4b84-ba1f-196a68f74ef1">
<br />
<br />
Baking in grasshopper:

<img width="200" alt="rhino7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d53ce7a2-c8aa-40ae-8d96-b0d5431b005d">
<br />
<br />
I had a fun time with these parameter changes. What was driving me to make these specific changes was to see how far I could push the limits without "breaking" the phone stand (turning it red). The visual component built into this with the green, yellow, and red gradient is very helpful to visual and understand what is possible/not possible when 3D printing.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<ins> Experiment with generating a new basic grasshopper</ins> 

This is where I stuggled the most and also grew the most this week. I created a new file with grasshoppping and rhino for the first time! I first went through a tutorial that walked me through creating a new file, but I was much more successful in class during the grasshopper workshop. The file shown below was made based on what we learned in that session.

Grasshopper file:

<br />
Baking:

<br />
<br />
Rhino model:

<br />
<br />
<h2>Speculations </h2> 
Before this class, I had no expereinece in computational design, nor had I ever heard of it. I speculate computational design will become more prevelant in many different industry, not just design and engineering. Even if the direct tools like grasshopper and Rhino are not relevant in a certain field, as more people learn the impact and mindset of computation design, work may morph into something more robust and module.

# Report 1 - Week of 8/29/24 - oh no, I'm addicted to the laser cutter

<h2>Reflections</h2>
This week I used the green laser cutter in Jacobs hall for the first time and had a blast! I signed up for a 30 minute reservation and ended up staying for over 2.5 hours. I started by cutting funky shapes to make earrings, which took quite a few tried to get sizing correct.

<img width="200" alt="First Earring Attempt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0efb044-a066-49d6-9369-456ce39910d1">
<img width="200" alt="Many Earring Attempts" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8adf529-bd5c-4ed8-bec0-810030c7cea7">

Next, I moved on to creating a print for my partner's birthday. I found quickly that printing photos that have enough contrast is difficult and takes a lot of trial and error. The photo on the left was my first attempt with standard etch settings. The right photo is my second and final attempt after I used lightroom to adjust contrast using masks to make the subjects pop and increased the power of the laser cutter etching by 20%. Both prints are ~8x10 inches and took ~30 minutes to print.

<img width="200" alt="Print Attempt 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18f2689d-935d-4eb7-8e01-f66436ef42db">
<img width="200" alt="Print Attempt 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1debc453-2899-40e3-a4b2-08bdbcd352cb">

Finally, I printed a key chain of my dog. I did not stick around long enough to try again with better contrast setting, but I plan to go back in again and redo this one.

<img width="200" alt="Dog Keychain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673369e0-5d47-41a5-a72e-cb5fb9772698">

While cutting the pieces, I had a great time working with and learning from Cody in the maker space about settings, tips and trick, and general best practices of laser cutter use.

<h2>Speculations</h2>
The tools and machines we have access to in MDes are like nothing I have encountered. I speculate that with an understanding of what tools can do, I will be much more effective in my work and the industries I find myself in.
