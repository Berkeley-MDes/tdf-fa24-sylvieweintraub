# Report 12 - Week of 11/14/24 - we are not given what we need to succeed
<h2>Reflections</h2>
The cohort is doing the best they can this week and I appreciate the effort. Honestly, having to complete our prototype by the Monday after thanksgiving is stressful and unfair to those that are traveling to spend the holiday with family. On top of this deadline, starting thanksgiving day (the thursday before the deadline), our cohort no longer has access to the studio microfab printers. I and many classmates I have talked to are stressed about having access to what we need to suceed with such a short timeline for this project. It would have been more respectful to us and our learning experience if we were given more time with the preoject requirements so we were able to accurately order the materials we actually needed earlier. This is how I see it from a schedule and roadblock perspective:
<br />
<br />
- Thursday, Nov 21: Proposal Due
<br />
...
<br />
4 days, but no materials have come yet
<br />
... 
<br />
- Monday, Nov 25: Proof of concept, aka a working part of our project to prove we can do it (how if we dont have the specific materials we ordered?)
<br />
...
<br />
1 day of working time, 2 holiday days (should be spent with family if desired)
<br />
...
<br />
- Thursday, Nov 28: lose access to 4 out of the 10 3D printers for the reamainder of the semester
<br />
...
<br />
1 holiday day (should be spent with family if desired), 2 days of working time
<br />
...
<br />
- Monday, Dec 3: full working prototype
<br />
<br />
To me, this feels unreasonable. I wish we were afforded more time with the necessary materials and inforamtion to execute this project in a way that empowers us to truley learn rather than scramble.
<br />
<br />
I also have been reflecting on this course as a whole and have some suggestions (I have also sent these directly to Sudhu).
<br />
- videos cannot be put into our portfolios as is because there is lots of class-specific information (challenge level most prominently, but I also would not included diagrammatic analysis or speculations in my portfolio)
<br />
  - I suggest the rubric is changed to include guidelines on how to create a video that is portfolio ready
  <br />
  - Diagrams, specualtions, and challenge levels are included in the report, that should be sufficient
  <br />
  <br />
- weekly reports will not be used or looked at after the semester and people view it as tedious work
<br />
  - I suggest weekly submissions are framed as "imagine you are creating a portfolio entry at the end of the project. Think about objectives, role, skills, process steps, challenges overcome, etc. Write a weekly update that will contribute to this entry." and maybe even have the first section in the report be called "executive summary" and encourage that to be a portfolio-ready summary of the project

<br />
<br />
<h2>Speculations</h2>
I speculate this class will need a refresh to ensure the next cohort is getting what they need out of the material. The skills that come out of this class are very important, and I fear I only learned a fraction of what I wanted to.
<br />
<br />
Here is a the same sketch I made last week, posted again to fulfil the rubric requirements for this post:

# Report 11 - Week of 11/7/24 - Project 4 here I come
<h2>Reflections</h2>
This week I completed my project 3 - SylvieBot project report and thought more about what I want to do for Project 4. I have been talking a lot with Roopa and we recently added Kaden to the project, as well. We are getting excited about the direction of the project. Here is my rough sketch of where we currently are at in our thought process.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<h2>Speculations</h2>
I speculate this nect project will be the best of all projects. I am excited to learn even more about microcontrollers through Arduino I also speculate learning Arduino will be much more useful from a industry-standard perspective.

# Report 10 - Week of 10/31/24 - Donald Trump is our 47th president
<h2>Reflections</h2>
This was a shit week where I did what I had to for survivial. I completed the the LLM project this week and had to do triceritops for my sanity. The LLM project was cool, I just wish I had more time and energy to learn more.
<br />
<br />
Here are the diagrams I created:
<br />

<h2>Speculations</h2>
I predict this country will not be able to socially handle 4 more years with a felon running our country with the house, senate, and supreme court on his side. I also think he will put restrictions on use of AI tools like the ones we built in this project, or he will use emerging technologies to hurt a lot of people. Really sad week.

# Report 9 - Week of 10/24/24 - On to the next
<h2>Reflections</h2>
This week I completed the report for Project 2, The Productivity Plant. Through this report process, I realized the progress I have made in naturally documenting my work and experiences. As I was compiling the information for the report, it ended up being surprisingly efficient to gather my thougths, reflections, and photos to convery the work I accomplished. I was also excited to see so much thoughtful feedback from the peer form. I feel like the cohort was an amazing community throughout this project, and everyone was excited to see how successful the groups were in their videos.

Now that we are starting project 3, I have done the following to prepar for the LLM module:

- Set up my ZeroWidth account
- Followed tutorials to at least make your first thing input+LLM+output.
- Reviewed project deliverables
- Reviewed project examples

I have never worked with LLMs so I am trying to do all the preparation I can to be ready to complete this quick sprint.

While experimenting with ZeroWidth, I was very impressed by the features that help new users understand what's going on. For example, when working with a node, the interface gives you an option to have the node explained. See photo below.
<br />
<img width="400" alt="Explain Node" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fcf81ca-9558-4cc0-8b1c-b91918adcc83">

I went through each demo to the best of my ability, but the links to the demos were all broken for me. See photo below:
<br />
<img width="400" alt="Error Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55da6047-b8e1-4a06-84fa-15d9d457acf1">

This was frustrating for me becasue we only have one more week to complete this stuff. But I think given everything, I might have this project my triceratops.

Pretty unrealited, but I started thinking about what my final project will be. I sketched it out, but will take time to exaplain it more in future weekly reports.
<br />

<h2>Speculations</h2>
I have never worked with LLMs, however, I have some experience using chatGPT to customize a bot to write like me. Through some very simple but somewhat tedious steps, it's easy to create a chatGPT bot to write in the style of any person. I specultate this type of bot assitant will become more and more common, and kids will eventually grow up learning to use AI as a resource rather than needing to become incredible writers on their own.

# Report 8 - Week of 10/17/24 - Project 2 complete!
<h2>Reflections</h2>
This week I accomplished the following:<br />
- Re-printed the plant frame and pot lid to fit all of the hardware<br />
- Attached the printed skeleton arms to the servo<br />
- Learned to crochet<br />
- Crocheted the enture exterior or plant<br />
- Trouble shooted hardware with Roopa<br />
- Tested hardware with Roopa<br />
- Debugged code with Roopa and Hanna<br />
- Scripted our video<br />
- Recorded audio for video<br />
- Edited the full video<br />
<br />

It was a slightly tough week balancing hte dymanics of a group project, but overall I learned a lot and grew as a technologist and designer.
<br />
<br />
Here is the video I created for the Productivity Plant porject:

[![Digital Ecosystem Project Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d620a08e-68c5-42f1-85c0-273de0b6b2e9)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K41SBc-6Cxw)

<h2>Speculations</h2>
These are the sepculations I wrote for the video, which stand:

Throughout this project, we spent a lot of time troubleshooting, debugging, and creating many iterations of our work. For example, we printed the frame of the plant and plant pot 3 times before perfecting it for use with the circuit components. We also dedicated a few days to testing and debugging the code.

We speculate that there will be continued evolution in AI tools to make the process of developing digital ecosystems better the first time, therefore increasing efficiency during the iteration and troubleshooting phases.

Additionally, so much technology being created puts emphasis on being clean, minimalistic, and ulta-futuristic. Some examples are the Tesla cybertruck and apple vision pro headset. We speculate there will be a general shift away from the futuristic design aesthetic back to 80s and 90s inspired approachable, huggable tech.

# Report 7 - Week of 10/10/24 - In need of the productivity plant while in the process of making the productivity plant

<h2>Reflections</h2>
Another challenging week working on Project 2, the productivity plant. I really love the purpose of this project, and it's a lot to take on in the time allotted. The highligh of the week is that my team functions really well together, even working through challenging tasks. Each team member has identified a field they currently have little or no experience with and is acting as lead in that field to grow our skills and take on a more difficult challenge. The team roles are as follows.

- Hanna Khoury - Axolotl - Software/Code Lead
- Roopa Ramanujam  - Axolotl - Electrical Hardware Lead
- Sylvie Weintraub - Axolotl - Fabrication Lead

As fabrication lead, this week I took on a combination of modeling, 3D printing, getting very crafty, and working with Roopa to figure out the hardware components I will need to design with.

For the prodictivity plant project, there are two products that need to be created: the plant and the wearable sound and motion monitor. First, I helped Roopa by creating sketches of these two products. 
<br />
<img width="400" alt="plant drawing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2407cad-41a9-4a47-a57b-ae8f9c1448e1">

<img width="400" alt="wearable drawing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d412df-7233-4fae-bc0f-5538e105d513">

Next, I focused on the plant fabrication. The plant product has 3 main fabrication components:
- The pot
- The plant frame
- The plant exterior

<ins> The Pot </ins> 
<br />
For the pot, I learned and used Fusion360 for the first time! I am very proud I pushed myself to try something new. Originally I was planning to use Rhino since I leared it in the last project, however, I know Fusion is another industry standard so I wanted to take this on as one of my Axolotl level challenges.
<br />
<br />
The model includes a 1) classic shaped pot for the Photon and breadboard to sit in with a hole for the power cord and 2) a platform for the plant to sit on with a hole for the wires.
Here is the plant pot model:
<br />
<img width="400" alt="plant pot model" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d45d96db-d17d-4505-b6ec-9841e31cf5b9">
<br />
<br />
Here is the platform model:
<br />
<img width="400" alt="platform model" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294f91a8-4da1-4534-9a0c-5bad82f87b10">
<br />
<br />
Here is the finished pot print:
<br />

<br />
<br />
Here is the finished platform prints with adjusted size holes. One fits the servo and one only fits wires:
<br />
<img width="400" alt="finsihed platform print" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f9ef76-6a1a-4128-bf31-ebbfe0ec5816">
<br />
<br />
<ins> The Plant Frame </ins> 
<br />
I then modeled and printed the frame of the plant that will hold the shape and attach to the servo motors and OLED screen.
<br />
<img width="400" alt="plant frame" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a5492bb-036f-4a36-9378-bad98b6e4d99">
<br />
<br />
<ins> The Plant Exterior </ins> 
<br />
Our team has decided we want a crochet plant exterior. I do not know how to crochet, and I have not started on this yet. When I modeled the parts, however, I used inspiration I found online to help generally line up how I want the exterior to look and feel. Here are all the parts modeled plus the exterior idea/inspiration.
<br />
<img width="400" alt="full model" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/645966cc-4c32-43c9-a31d-f9a6082e075d">
<br />
<br />
<h2>Speculations</h2>
For this project, we created three very distinct roles; code, hardware, fabricate. I can already tell these roles do not have clean serparations betweemn them. For example, as fabrication lead, I need to work with hardware to make sure I model with all componenets in mind. Hardware needs to work with code to test the componenets, and code needs to in turn with work both fabrication and hardware to make sure functionality of the parts work with the physical design. I speculate that tghe best teams are those that have people with expertise but can speak the language of all specialties on the project.

# Report 6 - Week of 10/3/24 - Tough week, but I'm really excited about Project 2

<h2>Reflections</h2>
This was a very hard week for me for a number of reasons. The first is I had a personal emergency that required a significant amount of time I would typically spent on school work spent elsewhere. The second is I gave feedback about this course to the leadership team which ended up taking up quite a bit more mental energy and space than anticipated. For that reason, this was not best week in TDF.

Starting the week off, I worked on the homework that was due on Monday. Over the weekened I soldered the stemma QT interface board. I had never soldered before, so I had significant help from my classmates (mostly Kaylee Jung - huge shoutout Kaylee!!).

<img width="300" alt="homework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db191a6-d222-47cc-afb6-253543a51b27">
<img width="300" alt="homework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b75c2760-94dd-4e00-a509-76034ed9b4a2">
<img width="300" alt="homework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e38103e6-1800-46ce-930f-6b7baf1efec5">

I downloaded the files, opened them in Visual Studio Code, and typed the commands outlined for us in the instructions. I was unable to spend much time experiementing before the Monday class (personal reasons), but I am proud of what I accomplished nonetheless.

The second part of the week was spent creating my project 2 group, brainstorming our idea, addressing a quick turn to submit our group and topic idea, and creating a proposal for our project.

Roopa, Hanna, and I will be creating THE PRODUCTIVITY PLANT.

The goal of The Productivity Plant project is to understand the functionality of the Photon 2 microcontroller, explore technologies that track motion, noise and time, and communicate information to users using OLED screens and servo motors. This productivity enhancement and monitoring distributed digital ecosystem will utilize the cloud to allow for a network of Photons to communicate with one another. 

The Productivity Plant’s purpose is to assist users in engaging in their work and study time as efficiently as possible, specifically while in “deep work”. Users will be able to set a time goal for how long they would like to have an uninterrupted deep working session. The Productivity Plant will track how distracted the user gets through a smart broach that will pick up noise levels and movement. If the user is getting too distracted, they will be warned through the plant “wilting” and having a “sad” symbol or message written out on the OLED screen. The plant will return to “happy” when the user returns to productive working. After the allotted time for “deep work”, the Productivity Plant will alert users that time is up, encouraging users to get up from their seat and move around for approximately 5 minutes to promote sustainable productivity.

This functionality is inspired by the Pomodoro method, a studying and productivity method developed in the late 1980s. Research studies conducted on the Pomodoro method have concluded that by participating in the method while working, individuals would have longer work sessions, as well as mood and efficiency benefits when compared to taking self-regulated breaks. 

Here is a littel sketch to illustrate how it may work (from a user perspective, not including technology).

<img width="500" alt="Productivity Plant Sketch" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7099e825-07d5-4f6f-a077-4f8383ef7d60">

<h2>Speculations</h2>

I speculate that with more people like my cohort of MDes classmates that know how to integrate different technology componemts, more people will understand the art of the possible and design more innovative things. Rigth now, so many people have ideas but are held back by not understanding if something is possible, and if so, how to get started. I think great things will come our of classes like TDF from the students that are eager to build things that can change the world.

# Report 5 - Week of 9/26/24 - What's a microcontroller?

<h2>Reflections</h2>
According to TechTarget.com , "a microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller includes a processor, memory and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip." Wow! I had never heard of a microcontroller, so this was an informative week. 
<br />
<br />
I was especially happy with the cohort community since we have such a wide variety of expertise, comfortability, and people (me) who had experience with very few parts of this work. For example, Kaylee has a background in the hardware and Roopa has a background in software, so they helped me, Sun-Q, and each other all work through the tutorials together.
<br />
<img width="300" alt="community problems solving" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3e0018-54c0-42d6-985c-cfb1db3ff072">

Along with the microcontroller, the other technologies I used this week that are new to me include visual studio code, particle, c/c++, an array, breadboards, pressure sensors, oh my!

This week I:
1. compiled and flahsed all files sent in the slack folder
2. compiled, flashed, and wired 3 of the tutorials listed in the wiki
3. experimented with changing variables, names, and processes
4. considered how some of the pieces of the ecosystem demo might relate to other systems
<br />
<ins>Compile and flash all files sent in the slack folder</ins>
<br />
After the class where we started working through these files together, I went home and tried to load, compile, and flash the remaining files on my own. I did plug in the hardware and test the flashes too which made it very reactive and fun. The first few times I used visual studio in my own I fumbled around with the terminals, particle, and using hte proper settings. Once I figured it out and repeated the process for a few files, the patterns started to set in and it became more natural. This is one of the first setups I wired on my breadboard:
<br />
<img width="300" alt="breadboard with button and LED" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca16a98-6bce-43d4-893f-e684babb2d3e">
<br />
<br />
<ins>Compile, flash, and wire 3 of the tutorials listed in the wiki</ins>
<br />
<br />

[FSR -> LED color](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-equilet/blob/main/project_demonstrables/particle_workbench/fsr_to_ledcolor/README.md)

This was the first one I completed and it got me so exicted to continue! I didn't know it was so simple to have a pressure-sensative system and it makes me want to learn more about what is happening technilogically within the pressure sensor. While I have not worked with breadboards or small circuits in the past, I did a short stint at a manufacturing company where they wired up large panel boards. Because of this, I was immediately comfortable with the hardware diagrams. The only question I came across during this tutorial was with the LED. Of the 4 leads (this is a term I looked up and don't know if I'm using right), how do I know where the longest one goes? A classmate helped me figure this out and it worked on the first try! See video below of the pressure changing the color of the LED.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d516e20-58b1-40ec-9181-5566d68d6baf

[Button Send on Change](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-equilet/blob/main/project_demonstrables/particle_workbench/basic_button_soc/README.md)

Next I worked on the button send on change. This was a ver simple hardware set up which I had no roadblocks with. I also had no roadblocks loading in the code, compiling, flashing, and using the serial monitor. As shown in the video below, when the button is pressed, the interaction is logged as a state change as indicated on the serial monitor as well as in the event traffic section on the particle console.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4b9c1b-d87a-45df-82e3-8270149ada0c

[Publish/Subsribe Introduction](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-equilet/blob/main/project_demonstrables/particle_workbench/publish_subscribe/README.md)

This is the tutorial I struggled most with. The publish part worked great! I published to my particle console no problem with the code provided. See video below.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55efffcd-79d0-4be7-b19f-3593442095f3

The sibscribe part I could not figure out msotly because I dont know what I am supposed to be looking for to understand "sucess." I tried to look at the information published on my own photon, as well as on another of my class mates. I think it ended up working? I added Roopa's photon to see activty on my console and I think that means it was successful (see screenshot below), but I am still trying to figure out what the code does.

<img width="500" alt="Roopa's photon added to my producst" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5af8cd8-e8fe-487d-b7ed-f40069023b9b">
<br />
<br />


<br />
<ins>Experiment with changing variables, names, and processes</ins>
<br />
What I realized through this is changing names doesnt actually do anything other than break the code :'). Because coding is very new to me, it took a while to understand what a variable is, that the name really doesnt matter and I can change it to anything I want AS LONG AS it's changed to the new name everywhere in the code. I also played with changing delay times and other numeric values to see how it impacted the code. I clearly am out of my depth when it comes to overall coding and creating working functions through code. However, by playing with the existing code provided to us, I am starting to understand the basics of each part of the code does and controls.
<br />
<br />
<ins>Consider how some of the pieces of the ecosystem demo might relate to other systems</ins> 
<br />
In general this prompt confused me a bit, but I think the point is to think about how the photon, code, and hardware are an ecosystem similar to the ecosystem I mapped last week (taking a photo on a phone). All of these technological systems include software, hardware, and interaction points for a user, which creates an ecosystem of inforamtion flow and feedback. By loading the files sent and going through the tutorials on the wiki, I am creating essicially a very very basic version of the complex ecosystem found around a computer or phone. Very cool!
<br />
<br />

<h2>Speculations</h2>
I predict in the future more professional and careers will crosspaths with the ecosystems of technology. Before TDF, I had never worked with a microcontroller or ever knew what it was. If I had though, I would have a much more informed view of my interactions with technology ecosystems. This important information is not accessible to most people, but I predict more will seek out as technology continues to run our world.

# Report 4 - Week of 9/19/24 - I love mapping!

<h2>Reflections</h2>
In wrapping up the Computational Design project, I spent most of this week finalizing my report. I put a lot of effort into this, and learned the importance of quality presentations through getting feedback from peers. I feel proud of the report and overall project I submitted for computational design! 

On Monday we put project 1 behind us and shifted to THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM!! The first assignment, creating a map of an ecosystem, was particularly fun for me.

Prior to MDes, I spent four years as a management consulant, in part doing service design work. While I am new to CAD modeling, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc., ecosystem mapping is something I have done many times. In my role, we did many types of maps such as ecosystem maps, stakeholder maps, service design blueprints, journey maps, and more. This week, I decided to create a service design blueprint for a personal device ecosystem, specfically the action of using a phone to take a photo.

I love service design blueprints because I think they do a great job showing a user's journey, what they interct with (frontstage), and what happens behind the scenes to enable their experience (backstage) in a clear, comprehendable way. In this blueprint, the arrows indicate connections, and I added icons to specifically call out at which steps information flow and feedback occurs. I also added enabling systems at the bottom, which at a very high level gets into the technology within the phone that enables the backstage actions, frontstage actions, and ultimately the user journey.
<br />
<br />
<img width="1000" alt="service design blueprint" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db2a07b5-a70b-4f42-a325-bd55656f10171">
<br />
Here is a sketch of a general blueprint:

<br />
<br />
<h2>Speculations</h2>
In my former work, we embraced ecosystems and used maps to document current states, make predictions and recomendations, define ideal futute states, and more. I speculate more industries will adopt this practice to further whatever work they are doing, if they haven't already done so. 


# Report 3 - Week of 9/12/24 - Big week for me, Grasshopper, and 3D printing

<h2>Reflections</h2>
I learned A LOT this week. I 3D printed for the first time, learned a lot more about Rhino and Grasshopper, used Rhino to both 3D print and laser cut, and more! This was an especially inspiring week because I feel like I not only pushed myself and grew a ton, I also had so much support for the MDes and Jacobs Hall community. To list a few moments that I was grateful for--one of my classmates walked me through using the Jacob's 3D printers step by step without my even asking, Cody in the makerspace sat with me and took the time to help me truly understand Grasshopper, I watched people in my cohort stay late late into the evening to help other get their work done. The community became strong this week.

As for my own personal contributions, I repaid the favors in every way I could--helping others set up their prints, printing a part when someone had to leave campus, etc.

I am proud of the work I have done so far, including the parts I printed and the video I created for this project. Here are the parts!

To make these, I did not start with hand sketches. I played with Rhino and Grasshopper until my loose vision came to life. In please of sketches, here are the models I "sketeched."

<h2>Speculations</h2>
I speculate computational design will continue to evlove with tools like Adam. We had a demostration of this AI modeling tool in DESINV 200, and it blew my mind. It really seemed huge. I also have been thinking espeically hard about the useage of plastics in 3D printing, and I predict there will be more sustainable materials emerging.

# Report 2 - Week of 9/5/24 - I've never touched rhino or grasshopper until this week (embarrassing!!)

<h2>Reflections</h2>
Overall, I was challenged this week. Grasshopper and Rhino are tools I have never touched, and the last time I tried modeling in a CAD program was in 2016 🥲. To grow these nex skills, I focused on the following 3 assignments:

  1. Make a diagram of the example phone stand grasshopping file
  2. Experiment with the example phone stand grasshopping file (adjusting parameters and baking)
  3. Experiment with generating a new basic grasshopper file
<br />
<br />
<ins> Make a diagram of the example phone stand grasshopping</ins> 
This process was very interesting! Going through a the grasshopper file step by step and digesting it enough to reframe it was a great way for me to learn. This (paired with the 9/9 class grasshopper workshop) has been the first time grasshopper started to sink in. 

To create this diagram, I had both figjam and the grasshopper up on my screen, and I went step by step in grasshopper, traslating my understadning into figjam. Here it is!

<br />
<br />
<ins> Experiment with the example phone stand file (adjusting parameters and baking)</ins> 
This was a fun exercise and a great way to play with grasshopper without having any prior experience. Here are all the ways documented I manipulated the file (I did a lot more poking, but at some point taking screen shots seemed redundant).

Starting point:

<br />
Adjusting sphere 2 center z and cylinder void radius to compensate:

Having fun with unrealistic phone sizes and shapes through grasshopper:

<img width="200" alt="rhino6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617602ce-5db7-4b84-ba1f-196a68f74ef1">
<br />
<br />
Baking in grasshopper:

<br />
<br />
I had a fun time with these parameter changes. What was driving me to make these specific changes was to see how far I could push the limits without "breaking" the phone stand (turning it red). The visual component built into this with the green, yellow, and red gradient is very helpful to visual and understand what is possible/not possible when 3D printing.

<ins> Experiment with generating a new basic grasshopper</ins> 

This is where I stuggled the most and also grew the most this week. I created a new file with grasshoppping and rhino for the first time! I first went through a tutorial that walked me through creating a new file, but I was much more successful in class during the grasshopper workshop. The file shown below was made based on what we learned in that session.

Grasshopper file:

Baking:

<br />
Rhino model:

<br />
<h2>Speculations </h2> 
Before this class, I had no expereinece in computational design, nor had I ever heard of it. I speculate computational design will become more prevelant in many different industry, not just design and engineering. Even if the direct tools like grasshopper and Rhino are not relevant in a certain field, as more people learn the impact and mindset of computation design, work may morph into something more robust and module.

# Report 1 - Week of 8/29/24 - oh no, I'm addicted to the laser cutter

<h2>Reflections</h2>
This week I used the green laser cutter in Jacobs hall for the first time and had a blast! I signed up for a 30 minute reservation and ended up staying for over 2.5 hours. I started by cutting funky shapes to make earrings, which took quite a few tried to get sizing correct.

<img width="200" alt="First Earring Attempt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0efb044-a066-49d6-9369-456ce39910d1">

<br />
Next, I moved on to creating a print for my partner's birthday. I found quickly that printing photos that have enough contrast is difficult and takes a lot of trial and error. The photo on the left was my first attempt with standard etch settings. The right photo is my second and final attempt after I used lightroom to adjust contrast using masks to make the subjects pop and increased the power of the laser cutter etching by 20%. Both prints are ~8x10 inches and took ~30 minutes to print.
<br />
<img width="200" alt="Print Attempt 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18f2689d-935d-4eb7-8e01-f66436ef42db">
<img width="200" alt="Print Attempt 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1debc453-2899-40e3-a4b2-08bdbcd352cb">

Finally, I printed a key chain of my dog. I did not stick around long enough to try again with better contrast setting, but I plan to go back in again and redo this one.

While cutting the pieces, I had a great time working with and learning from Cody in the maker space about settings, tips and trick, and general best practices of laser cutter use.

<h2>Speculations</h2>
The tools and machines we have access to in MDes are like nothing I have encountered. I speculate that with an understanding of what tools can do, I will be much more effective in my work and the industries I find myself in.
