# Report 1- Week of 8/29 #

This week I used the green laser cutter in Jacobs hall for the first time and had a blast! I signed up for a 30 minute reservation and ended up staying for over 2.5 hours. I started by cutting funky shapes to make earrings, which took quite a few tried to get sizing correct.

Next, I moved on to creating a print for my partner's birthday. I found quickly that printing photos that have enough contrast is difficult and takes a lot of trial and error. The photo on the left was my first attempt with standard etch settings. The right photo is my second and final attempt after I used lightroom to adjust contrast using masks to make the subjects pop and increased the power of the laser cutter etching by 20%. Both prints are ~8x10 inches and took ~30 minutes to print.

Finally, I printed a key chain of my dog. I did not stick around long enough to try again with better contrast setting, but I plan to go back in again and redo this one.

While cutting the pieces, I had a great time working with and learning from Cody in the maker space about settings, tips and trick, and general best practices of laser cutter use.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team
